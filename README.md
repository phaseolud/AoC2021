# AoC2021
My solutions of the [advent of code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021). The `startday.py` command can be used to generate a template for a certain day as
`python startday.py <DAY>`. If no argument is given the current day is used. This command also downloads the input data from the advent of code website, using the session cookie (set in the `.env` file).
